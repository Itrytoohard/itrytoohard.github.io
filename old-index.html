    <p>This site was not generated with Jekyll as most Github Pages are.</p>
    <p>My goal is to learn how websites work, not to learn Jekyll.</p>
    <p>(Unless this is clearly untrue, which means I have given up at some point)</p>
    <p>Note: I have given up. I forgot how obnoxious it was that html doesn't have a way to repeat blocks on every page. Hopefully giving up on styling things myself will take longer.

# On Emacs


Emacs is simultaneously one of the most incredible pieces of software I have ever used and one of the worst monstrosities that has likely ever been produced. You can quite literally do anything in emacs. The only question is: How sane do you want to be afterwards?

Emacs is unique in that no other software is quite as unusable out of the box. Most Emacs users (that have ever used another editor) give up shortly after opening it for the first time. It is arcane.

It is not an exaggeration to say that Emacs is not for users that are new to Emacs. In many ways, it actively discourages them from even attempting to become familiar with it. Control-N,P,F,B are the keys it uses to move between lines. You may have noticed that those keys are not next to each other. Even VI has the curtesy to put its movement keys on hjkl. They might be weird, but at least they're *close*. Emacs also fools you into thinking it is a command line program. While there *is* a command line version of Emacs, the real Emacs is actually a GUI program. Does it tell you this anywhere after you foolishly type in `~$ emacs` ? Naturally not! Like many things in Emacs, you're supposed to just figure that out.
